                    - <strong>GUI Workflow:</strong> Input appointment details using form fields and buttons. Appointments are displayed, filtered, and sorted in a structured <em>TableView</em> with real-time updates for changes.<br>
                    - <strong>Validation:</strong> Strict rules enforce data integrity, such as valid dates, provider availability, and non-overlapping appointments.<br>
                    - <strong>Dynamic Technician Assignment:</strong> Technicians are assigned to imaging appointments using a rotation system, ensuring balanced workloads.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Requirements:</strong><br>
                    - <strong>Java 17 or higher</strong> and <strong>JavaFX 17 or higher</strong> for proper functionality.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Future Enhancements:</strong><br>
                    - Add detailed patient profiles with medical history.<br>
                    - Implement login and role-based access for clinic staff and administrators.<br>
                    - Integrate database support for persistent storage of appointments and provider data.<br><br>
                    
                    The <strong>Clinic Manager GUI</strong> is a comprehensive solution for clinic scheduling needs, combining efficient appointment management with a user-friendly interface, robust validation, and a flexible architecture that allows for future enhancements.

                <h3>Spell Checker Program</h3>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Spell Checker Program</strong> is a project developed for the Rutgers University Systems Programming course. This program efficiently detects and reports spelling errors in one or more text files using a binary search through a dictionary file. Designed for accuracy and flexibility, it supports directory traversal and handles various input scenarios while ensuring precise error reporting.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Key Features:</strong><br>
                    - <strong>Multi-File and Directory Support:</strong> Processes individual text files or entire directories, skipping hidden files and directories starting with a ".".<br>
                    - <strong>Binary Search Algorithm:</strong> Utilized for fast and accurate dictionary lookups.<br>
                    - <strong>Error Reporting:</strong> Clearly identifies spelling errors with their file name, line number, and column position (e.g., <code>file1 (35,8): foom</code>).<br>
                    - <strong>Custom Input Handling:</strong> Handles edge cases such as hyphens, capitalization, and trailing punctuation, ensuring robust word processing.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>How It Works:</strong><br>
                    1. <strong>Finding Files:</strong> The <code>traverseDirectory</code> function opens and identifies all relevant files and directories for processing.<br>
                    2. <strong>Reading and Annotating Words:</strong> Extracts words from text files, calculates their positions, and accounts for punctuation and capitalization.<br>
                    3. <strong>Dictionary Lookup:</strong> Uses a binary search to check words against the dictionary file, reporting any misspelled words.<br>
                    4. <strong>Main Program:</strong> Combines all components in <code>spchk.c</code>, creating a comprehensive spell-checking solution.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Technology Stack:</strong><br>
                    - <strong>C:</strong> Core programming language used for efficient file handling and binary search implementation.<br>
                    - <strong>Unix File System:</strong> Enables directory traversal and file processing.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Testing:</strong><br>
                    - <strong>Part One:</strong> Tests file and directory traversal using <code>part_one_test.c</code>, ensuring all valid files are opened.<br>
                    - <strong>Part Two:</strong> Validates word extraction and position annotation with <code>part_two_test.c</code>, handling trailing punctuation and capitalization.<br>
                    - <strong>Part Three:</strong> Tests dictionary lookups using <code>part_three_test.c</code>, ensuring accurate word validation through binary search.<br>
                    - <strong>Comprehensive Testing:</strong> Combines all parts into <code>spchk.c</code> for end-to-end functionality testing.<br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Usage:</strong><br>
                    Compile and run the program using the following commands:<br>
                    <code>gcc -o spchk spchk.c</code><br>
                    <code>./spchk /path/to/dictionary file_or_directory1 file_or_directory2</code><br><br>
                    
                    <strong>Examples:</strong><br>
                    <code>gcc -o spchk spchk.c /usr/share/dict/words testingDirectory test.txt .test.txt</code><br>
                    <code>./spchk</code><br><br>
                    
                    The <strong>Spell Checker Program</strong> is an excellent demonstration of systems programming skills, including efficient data structures, file handling, and robust testing practices. It provides an accurate and user-friendly approach to identifying and addressing spelling errors in text files.
